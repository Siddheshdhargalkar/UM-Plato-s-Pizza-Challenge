Plato's Pizza Challenge: A BI Consultant Project
Project Overview
This project highlights my role as a Business Intelligence (BI) Consultant for Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizzeria in New Jersey. The goal was to analyze transactional data and provide actionable insights to improve operations, sales, and efficiency.

Upon joining, I received a note from the manager, Mario Maven:
"Welcome aboard! We've been collecting transactional data over the past year, but haven’t fully utilized it. We’d like your help to uncover opportunities to increase sales and optimize operations. Here are a few key questions we'd like to answer:

What days and times are the busiest?
How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
What are our best and worst-selling pizzas?
What’s the average order value?
How well are we utilizing our seating capacity (15 tables, 60 seats)?
If you have additional insights or ideas, feel free to share – you're the expert!"*
Key Objectives

Identify sales patterns (e.g., peak times, busiest days).
Understand product performance (top-selling and least-selling pizzas).
Calculate average order values and analyze customer behavior.
Evaluate seating utilization for capacity management.
